ABSTRACT

Welcome to E-Judiciary, a premier, centralized, tech-powered court operations platform poised to address real-time challenges plaguing the Indian judicial system. Equipped with a comprehensive suite of features, this app streamline court operations and catalyses the democratization of the legal landscape. Our key goals with this app include transparency, accessibility, and efficiency; three words not usually associated with the existing judicial system, despite the government’s efforts. We aim to aid courts in achieving paperless justice delivery, furthering Nandan Nilekani’s vision of achieving Atmanirbhar Bharat via development of in-house capacity and capability to drive social development of the country.

KEY FEATURES

E-FILING 

Our Model: A powerful digitising tool, virtually recreating the traditional case filing system on a single platform. We use Google Firebase as our BaaS Database platform.

Expansion Plans: Future initiatives include onboarding e-services of other government agencies. For example, the police have their own systems in place for evidence processing, FIR protocols, etc. All of these can be given a path to our app and a unified case can be filed. Our current system houses an Upload Documents section under E-Filing, but the aforementioned is a more direct and failsafe method.

COURT CALENDAR

Our Model: Featuring an interactive UI/UX, the calendar may act as a roster for user-selected courts, automating the generation of daily schedules. Its tech stack takes into account databases of court availability, court details, etc.

Expansion Plans: To further distinguish the app E-Judi from existing solutions, the calendar shall flag inordinate delays, monitor and cap case adjournments to 3 (required by law - but not always followed), alongside optimizing hearings to be listed. This takes place from an administrator’s login, requiring RBAC integration to the app. A 2.0 version could also include a model for metrics generation to measure and increase the efficiency of individual benches and courts.

CASE STATUS

Our Model: Serving as a search option across databases, the case status feature provides concise information for a case number, useful for a targeted search.

Expansion Plans: Making it easier for clients to search for cases while having less information. For instance, our current model requires the case number, which may not be available to or remembered by all the involved parties. By expanding the number of fields that can be used, petitioner name, for example, we can reach a wider audience looking for information. If RBAC is included in the app’s version 2.0, tagging and passing of cases between courts is also an innovative and prudent feature that can be added.

E-REPOSITORY

Our Model: Serves as a directory to official websites of courts the user might be looking for during in-depth research.

Expansion Plans: The addition of a web crawler for faster lookup, is also useful when the end-user has limited information on the case, as websites require more fields than most people will have at hand.

CONCLUSION

A system of this nature is designed to be inclusive, drawing in judges, litigants, advocates, other stakeholders and citizens to correct inequalities in information distribution, cutting across the otherwise hierarchical and potentially corrupt mechanisms of a typical Indian court. It will also allow for systematic case planning, help save time, aid in the decision-making process, and improve accountability. Serving as a consolidated information source, it establishes connections between multiple departments and institutions. With continuous improvement at its core, E-Judi sets a new standard by not only streamlining existing processes but also introducing innovative functionalities. This platform is not just a tool; it is a commitment to reshaping the legal landscape, making justice more accessible and citizen-friendly.
